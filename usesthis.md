### Who are you, and what do you do?

My legal name is John Kordich and I am currently based in Redmond, WA. I design, connect, and write software for my career. In my free time I read, create music and art, actively love and tend to my friends, and take care of my home and community.

### What hardware do you use?

I used PC Part Picker to build a desktop machine in early 12020 HE:
- Intel i9-9900k
- Gigabyte Aorus Z390 motherboard
- 64 GB RAM
- 1 TB Samsung EVO 970
- ~~Nvidia 2080 Ti~~ Nvidia 3070 Ti (My 2080 Ti died and is currently being repaired by MSI, which has taken 3 months so far)
- Logitech G432 Headset
- Logitech G502 Mouse
- Durgod K320 Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches
- XBox Controller Model 1708

It's a beautiful machine and it performs great!

I use a Pixel 6 Pro, and it captures beautiful images, videos, and audio of my friends and me.

I also have a Raspberry Pi cluster (6 devices) in my garage, which run Ubuntu 20.04, k3s, a bunch of Discord bots that I wrote to do silly things (like 'flatten' images/videos to 1 dimension), and various other applications.

### And what software?
- Dual booting Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 on my PC
- VS Code and IntelliJ for software development
- Rust is my preferred language for software development, but I also use Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Go, Bash, PowerShell, and Typescript
- Emacs org-mode to take notes, keep a log, and track TODOs
- Signal for communication with my friends, Discord for online communities
- [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for encryption/decryption of individual files and messages
- Azure Storage Explorer for cloud storage
- Prometheus for measuring the health of all my devices and applications
- Jenkins for automated tasks
- [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) in my Raspberry Pi cluster
- Firefox: Google Mail/Calendar/Drive/Sheets, YouTube, Soundcloud, Reddit, Hacker News

### What would be your dream setup?

- Dell U4021QW for creative/software work
- Adobe Creative Suite
- Wacom Cintiq Pro
- Logitech Lift virtical mouse
- An assortment of VST/VSTi plugins
- A top of the line Nvidia 40xx GPU when they are available, for model training
- I have been tempted by the Turing Pi 2, but I'm not sure I can justify the cost. I can almost certainly get better performance and power efficiency out of a single machine with a low end 12th generation Intel CPU. Also, Raspberry Pis are unavailable at MSRP virtually everywhere, so I'd have to overpay for them
- I would like several tiny devices that can collect time series about the health of my plants, something like a Raspberry Pi Zero or even smaller. Simply put: devices that can take scientific measurements, run a basic prometheus exporter, and have WiFi!
